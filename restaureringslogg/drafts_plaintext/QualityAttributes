Major Quality Attributtes for Agenda
 * Availability
   Amount of downtime during a year. Critical for services delivered over a computer network. Agenda will deliver shift management services to their customers from one central server. <Single point of failure>.
 * Security
   Measure of how hard it is to compromise the system through bypassing implemented user authentication services. Clearly, an employee really should not under any circumstance be able to actually access Agenda's data model and tinker with it to the extent that he or she seems to be on a false sick leave. A popular system requirement for corporate software during early development is "The software system should be secure." Occasionally it is more cost effective to bother with integrity.
 * Usability
   Measure of how fast and easily the customer learns to deploy the software. Critical if customers deploy an MVP, as new, incemental releases must uphold this quality in order not to lose the customer to competitors or substitutes.
 * Modifiability
   Measure of how fast changes to the system may be made
 * Reliability
   The probability that a system will not fail and that it will perform its intended function for a specified time interval.
 * Efficiency
   Measure of how fast users can complete tasks the functionality of the software is supposedly supporting. In the case of Agenda, an HR manager should be able to swiftly assign an employee to a shift, detach an employee off a shift, and edit the schedule of a shift, and with more ease then with the competition.
 * Correctness
   The software must adhere to its functional requirements. May seem trivial, but following up on functional requirements is indeed easier written then done.
 * Testability
   Tesitifies as to how complicated the testing phase is. A software system that is deployed early on in its life cycle, desparately needs to be easily tried and tested.
 * Scalability
   Measure of how the system perform performs as the database grows.
 * Performance
   Measure of how fast the system responds to user interaction.
 * Transparancy
   It should be easy and swift to troubleshoot the software during development, testing and deployment.

Minor Quality Attributtes for Agenda
 * Integrity
   Measure of how well the software performs while compromised. Not to be confused with security.
 * Portability
   Measure of many platforms the software can be made to support. Agenda is web-based, no porting is nescessary, unless we want to support Internet Explorer too.
 * Reliability
   Measure of how consistent the software is by change of work environment.
 * Flexibility
   Measure of how modifiable the software is and how easy it is to interface it towards 3rd party systems. Currently not a critical attribute for the Mnimum Viable Product.
 * Interoperability
   Measure of how well the software exchanges data with other services within the organization it is deployed in. Later increments of Agenda may integrate better towards payroll systems, recruitment software or other Information Systems the HR management may deploy.
